from best to worst

O(1)              -->      Constant
O(log n)          -->      Logarithmic
O(n)              -->      Linear
O(nlog n)         -->      n log n
O(n^2)            -->      Quadratic


log is base 2 not base 10


Time complexities of Array/Arraylist operations

Retrieve with index                                       -->       O(1) - constant time
Retrieve without index                                    -->       O(n) - linear time
Add an element to a full array                            -->       O(n)
Add an element to the end of an array (has space)         -->       O(1)
Insert or update and element at a specific index          -->       O(1)
Delete an element by setting it to null                   -->       O(1)
Delete an element by shifting elements                    -->       O(n)

get / put / remove                                        -->       O(1)
