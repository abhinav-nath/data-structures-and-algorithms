---------------------------
 LinkedHashMap - since 1.4
---------------------------
public class LinkedHashMap<K,V>
extends HashMap<K,V>
implements Map<K,V>

- Hash table and linked list implementation of the Map interface
- Insertion order is preserved
- Maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries
- permits null values and one null key
- not synchronized unlike HashTable

----------------------------
 LinkedHashMap as LRU Cache
----------------------------

A special constructor is provided to create a linked hash map whose order of iteration is the order in which its entries were last accessed, from least-recently accessed to most-recently (access-order).
This kind of map is well-suited to building LRU caches.

Invoking the put, putIfAbsent, get, getOrDefault, compute, computeIfAbsent, computeIfPresent, or merge methods results in an access to the corresponding entry (assuming it exists after the invocation completes).

The replace methods only result in an access of the entry if the value is replaced.

The putAll method generates one entry access for each mapping in the specified map, in the order that key-value mappings are provided by the specified map's entry set iterator.

No other methods generate entry accesses.
In particular, operations on collection-views do not affect the order of iteration of the backing map.

 Constructors
--------------
LinkedHashMap()
Constructs an empty insertion-ordered LinkedHashMap instance with the default initial capacity (16) and load factor (0.75).

LinkedHashMap(int initialCapacity)
Constructs an empty insertion-ordered LinkedHashMap instance with the specified initial capacity and a default load factor (0.75).

LinkedHashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)
Constructs an empty insertion-ordered LinkedHashMap instance with the specified initial capacity and load factor.

LinkedHashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor, boolean accessOrder)
Constructs an empty LinkedHashMap instance with the specified initial capacity, load factor and ordering mode.

LinkedHashMap(Map<? extends K,? extends V> m)
Constructs an insertion-ordered LinkedHashMap instance with the same mappings as the specified map.
